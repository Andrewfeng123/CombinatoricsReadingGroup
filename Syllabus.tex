\section{Objective}
To learn about combinatorics beyond those in math olympiads in a more rigorous fashion. To do so, we finish \textit{Applied Combinatorics} by April 2020.

\section{Schedule}
Weekly meetings are held on Saturdays 4-6 pm at Bahen to discuss previous problems and plan new problems. Members are expected to spend around 5 hours per week reading through the chapters and doing the planned problems at the end of chapter. For 2019, we plan to complete chapters 1-5.

\section{Content}
	\subsection{Week 1}
	Read \textbf{chapter 2, Strings, Sets, and Binomial Coefficients}. Do problems 7,8,16,17,18,20,21,22,26,29,30,31,32,33.
