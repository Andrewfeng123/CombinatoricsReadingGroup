\maketitle
	
\section{Objective}
To learn about combinatorics beyond those in math olympiads in a more rigorous fashion. To do so, we finish \textit{\href{https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/applied-combinatorics}{Applied Combinatorics}} by April 2020.

\section{Schedule}
Weekly meetings are held on Saturdays 4-6 pm at Bahen to discuss previous problems and plan new problems. Members are expected to spend around 5 hours per week reading through the chapters and doing the planned problems at the end of chapter. For 2019, we plan to complete chapters 1-5.
